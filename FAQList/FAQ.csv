"How does video playback work?","How does video playback work?","OneDrive and SharePoint video playback uses different playback technology depending on the video bitrate. Our Microsoft Stream player engine detects the optimal way to play the video for the best playback experience and performance.

Smaller videos (<3 Mbps bitrate or video itself is <5 Mb) - Use progressive playback, so the video needs to be created with a video codec supported by the browser and the device

Medium bitrate videos (3-50 Mbps) - Use ""just in time"" encoding to do adaptive bitrate streaming on the fly when a user plays the video and caches AES-128 encrypted parts of the video on the Azure Front Door CDN as many people play the video from the same geographic region

Microsoft Teams meeting recordings - Use a single bitrate that is streamed via encrypted chunks via CDN the same as medium bitrate videos above

Large bitrate videos (50+ Mbps) - Can't be played in the service and can be only downloaded for local playback",
